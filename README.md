# Learning-Rules-to-Hopfield-Type-Associative-Memories


Analysis, Comparisons and Construction of Learning Rules to Hopfield-Type Neural Networks in real and complex number systems. 

# Getting Started

This repository contain the Julia source-codes of Hopfield-Type learning rules on real and complex number systems. As described in the book chapter "Learning Rules to Hopfield Type Associative Memories" by Fidelis Zanetti and Rodolfo Anibal Lobo (see **Link**). The Jupyter-notebook of the computational experimens are also available in this repository.

In particular, we implemented the Correlation, Projection and Storkey learning rules, applying the Hopfield neural network as an associative memory.
For the complex case we explore two models, using *splitsign* and *csign* activation functions.
